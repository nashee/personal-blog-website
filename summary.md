Outlined below are steps of my development strategy

Step 1:
Create seprate files/folders for your html and css code

Step 2: 
Sketch a design; it doesn't need to be perfect

Step 3:
Start building the html skeleton for the main page; user udacity's html style guide

Step 4: 
Start building the html for the blog post

Step 5:
Begin using CSS for each of the html pages; use both flexbox and grid

Step 6:
Compare what you've built so far with your inital drawing and make adjustments

Step 7:
Check if the links you've included work properly

Step 8:
Test if everything works, doublecheck your work with the project rubric, push to github
